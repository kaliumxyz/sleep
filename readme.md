# sleep ðŸ˜´

> chromium extension to remind you when to go to sleep.

## install

Very wip, either just import it like an irl dev using the extensions page (after having enabled dev mode) or get an older release version from the chrome webstore: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/sleep/jfahcgjjbekmnamojanhbnmcpenagiea]

## usage

click on the nice "S" that appeared in you extensions bar, the menu will now open.

Set the time you want the alert to be and click on set, and boom, you're ready to go! An alert will pop up at the specified time :smile:.
